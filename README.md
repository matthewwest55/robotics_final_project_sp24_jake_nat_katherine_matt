`Final Project: Robot Hangman`
------------------

**Project Description**
------------------------
Goal:
In this project, we aim to create a Turtlebot that is able to use computer vision and inverse mechanics to play a game of hang-man with a user. The Turtlebot will use computer vision to read a users letter guess after it has been written on a white board, and then employ inverse kinematics to either add to the stick-figure or notate a correct guess.

Why this is interesting:
Incorporating user-robot interaction is something we are interested in exploring, because a dynamic program is being created. 

What were we able to accomplish:

Main components and how they fit together:
